## What I Learned:
- **Length** and **complexity** matter most for strong passwords.
- Passphrases are both secure and easy to remember.
- Poor passwords use real words and basic substitutions.
- Use a password manager for all accounts.
- Brute-force and dictionary attacks are defeated by strong, unique passwords.
- Enable multi-factor authentication everywhere.
